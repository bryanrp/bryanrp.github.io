# Hi there 👋

This is the files for my 🌐 website 🌐, made using WordPress and hosted on GitHub Pages. Maybe you are wondering how a dynamic site created using WordPress, can be hosted on GitHub Pages that only support static site. Thanks to my knowledge, skill, understanding, and patience of web development, I ... simply used a plugin, called [Simply Static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/). For now, there is only one page, but I will put more content here in the future 😉.
